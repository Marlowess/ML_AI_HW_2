    "In order to get a greater robustness to individual observations and obtain a better classification of most of the training observations, we can fit the model by using a soft margin classifier.\n",
    "The idea here is: rather than seeking the largest possible margin so that every observation is not only on the correct side of the hyperplane but also on the correct side of the margin, we instead allow some observations to be on the incorrect side of the margin, or even the incorrect side of the hyperplane. The margin is called soft because it can be violated by some of the training observations."
