    "SVM is an algorithm for classifying data that use the concept of margin to separate data in space.\n",
    "The objective is to find the hyperplane that better separate data and, at the same, compute the margin parameters that maximize the distance between data of different classes.\n",
    "The concept is the same as the perceptron: finding the hyperplane that separate data, but there's a big difference. In SVM, just few points are important for determining the hyperplane while we have to consider all points when we use the perceptron algorithm. We call these points support vectors, and they stay on the margin.\n",
    "There are more way to find the margins. A quick explanation is provided in two next subchapter.\n"
